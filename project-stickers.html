        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
          I created a set of custom promotional stickers for the Leeward Community College Marketing Department.
          These stickers were designed to attract student engagement, boost school pride, and support recruitment efforts during outreach events.
        </p>

        <h3>My Role</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Designed sticker artwork and typography to align with Leeward’s brand</li>
          <li>Prepared files for print and coordinated vendor production</li>
          <li>Worked with the Marketing Director to meet branding and deadline goals</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Tools Used</h3>
        <p>Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, Canva</p>

        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>
          The stickers were well-received by students and staff, frequently featured at events and on laptops and water bottles.
          They helped increase brand visibility in a fun, creative way.
